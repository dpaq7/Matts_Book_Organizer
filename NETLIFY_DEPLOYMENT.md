# Netlify Deployment Guide

Your Book Organizer frontend is ready for Netlify deployment from the monorepo!

## âœ… Repository Setup Complete

- âœ… Frontend built with SvelteKit + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- âœ… Netlify config (`netlify.toml`) in repository root
- âœ… Subdirectory deployment configured (`base = "frontend/"`)
- âœ… API proxy setup for backend communication
- âœ… Environment variable support
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design with dark/light themes

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Latest Changes
```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add SvelteKit frontend for Netlify deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign up/login

2. **Click "New site from Git"**

3. **Connect GitHub** and select `Matts_Book_Organizer` repository

4. **Build settings** (auto-detected from `netlify.toml`):
   - âœ… **Base directory**: `frontend/`
   - âœ… **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - âœ… **Publish directory**: `frontend/build`
   - âœ… **Node version**: 18

5. **Add environment variable**:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-app.onrender.com`
   - *(Replace with your actual Render backend URL)*

6. **Click "Deploy site"** ðŸš€

### 3. Update API URL

After deployment, get your Render backend URL and update:

**In Netlify Dashboard:**
- Site Settings â†’ Environment variables
- Update `VITE_API_URL` to your Render backend URL
- Trigger new deploy

**Or update `netlify.toml`:**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://your-actual-backend.onrender.com/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After successful deployment:

- âœ… **Frontend live** at `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- âœ… **Books loading** from your Render database (445 books)
- âœ… **Search working** across title, author, publisher
- âœ… **Statistics page** showing reading data with BEq calculations
- âœ… **Dark/light theme** toggle functional
- âœ… **Mobile responsive** design
- âœ… **Add/edit books** working through API

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Books not loading?

### Build failing?
- Check Netlify build logs
- Verify Node.js version (18+)
- Test build locally: `cd frontend && npm run build`
